<h2> Exploratory Data Analysis - Exploring MIMIC-III for Collaborative Disease Insights </h2>
<p>Diagnostic errors, occasionally made by physicians during the process of determining a patient’s condition,
can have severe consequences. These errors may worsen the patient’s illness or, in more tragic instances, even
result in fatalities. Beyond the harmful impact on individual health, such errors impose significant financial
burdens on patients, their insurance providers, and governmental healthcare systems. Furthermore, they
can damage the reputation and career prospects of the healthcare provider involved, particularly in cases
where incorrect medications are prescribed or incorrect diagnoses are made.[14] In our project, we have used
data mining methodologies to explore past patient records comprehensively, uncovering important insights to
enhance the diagnostic procedure. Through examination of disease symptoms, our methodology seeks to
precisely predict type of disease afflicting a patient. This effort will greatly improve how accurately diagnoses
are made and make the process more efficient. It’ll give strong backing to healthcare workers in their efforts
to diagnose illnesses.</p>
<p>In this project, we’re using the MIMIC-III medical dataset, which contains information about patients and
the notes doctors wrote during their assessments. Our goal is to analyze these notes to identify the diseases
or health issues patients might have. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the patients’ health
status and help in their medical treatment and care. Through in-depth analysis of the MIMIC-III database,
we have carefully screened and integrated data related to the top 10 most frequently occurring diseases. The
core objective of this study is to perform in-depth mining of the recorded texts of these diseases, focusing on
extracting key symptom information from them. Through this process, we have collected a comprehensive
symptom dataset and used it to train and test several innovative disease prediction models.</p>
